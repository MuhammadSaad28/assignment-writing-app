VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 4. Firestore Security Rules

Update your Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Profiles collection
    match /profiles/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/profiles/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Assignments collection
    match /assignments/{assignmentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/profiles/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Submissions collection
    match /submissions/{submissionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Withdrawals collection
    match /withdrawals/{withdrawalId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }

      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Storage Security Rules

Update your Storage security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /payments/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /submissions/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Install Dependencies
